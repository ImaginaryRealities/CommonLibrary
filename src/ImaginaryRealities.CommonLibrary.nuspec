        Version 2.0.0

        I removed the strong naming key from the framework assemblies.
        I reviewed the pros and cons of strong naming and decided that
        it doesn't fit in with the intended use of the framework and
        that the benefits to strong naming were non-existent.

        I changed the implementation of the Process Monitor integration
        code. The code now uses .NET safe handles instead of raw
        handles which should lead to less risk of handle leaks
        (although there was no evidence to suggest that there was a
        problem before; I just decided it was a better practice). I
        also fixed/updated some of the unit tests and increased code
        coverage.

        I created the ProcessMonitorException class. Exceptions that
        are reported by the Process Monitor framework will throw this
        exception instead of raw Exception objects.

        I updated the SemanticVersionNumber class to use version 2.0.0
        of the Semantic Versioning Specification. The big change here
        is that the build number is no longer considered when comparing
        version numbers. Also, the algorithm for comparing pre-release
        version numbers was altered to match a change in the
        specification. Pre-release identifiers that are numbers have a
        lower precedence than alphanumeric identifiers.
