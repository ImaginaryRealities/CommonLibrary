<h1>Welcome to the Common Library Project!</h1>
<p>
	This website contains the documentation, examples, news, and announcements for the ImaginaryRealities Common Library project hosted on GitHub. If you are using our Common Library with your project, please check back here often for news and developments on this project.
</p>
<p>
	The Common Library is a collection of reusable components that we have found that we are using often across multiple projects. They are not full blown frameworks, but the components do provide some form of significant value that we are able to encapsulate in a reusable package.
</p>
<p>
	We have released our Common Library under the MIT License. Please feel free to include these components in your own projects. For more information on the license, please see the <a href="license.html">licensing information page</a>.
